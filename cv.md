# Patrick McGreal - Full Stack Developer

## About me

Hi, I'm Patrick. I've been working as a full stack developer for over six years. I'm from the UK, but I live and work in Sweden.

I've worked on desktop software in the past, but these days I mainly focus on web apps.

You can find lots of examples of work in progress [on my GitHub account](https://github.com/patrick-mcgreal-dev).

## A few applications I've worked on
