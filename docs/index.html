<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Hi, I&#39;m Patrick. I&#39;ve been working as a full stack developer for over six years. I&#39;m originally from the UK, but I live and work in Sweden.</p>
<p>I build public-facing web apps, and internal software for businesses.</p>
<p>There&#39;s lots of code <a href="https://github.com/patrick-mcgreal-dev">on my GitHub account</a>. Maybe you want to check out <a href="https://github.com/patrick-mcgreal-dev/cv">the tool I use to generate this CV</a>.</p>
<h2>Some projects I&#39;ve worked on</h2>
<h3>NanoDocs</h3>
<p>NanoDocs is a tool I built for generating documentation. It&#39;s available as a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nanodocs">package via npm</a>.</p>
<p>It takes files written in Markdown format, and combines them into a single-page app that can be downloaded and browsed offline.</p>
<p>I continue to add new features, so check out the <a href="https://patrick-mcgreal-dev.github.io/nanodocs-docs/">documentation</a> for more details.</p>
<h3>100 Point Challenge</h3>
