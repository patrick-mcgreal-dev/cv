        <h1>Patrick McGreal</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Hi, I&#39;m Patrick. I&#39;m a full-stack developer with almost a decade of experience.</p>
<p>Right now I work mainly with JavaScript frameworks like Vue and React in the frontend, and Node in the backend. I&#39;ve also spent several years in the .NET world, and when it comes to databases I feel very comfortable with any flavour of SQL.</p>
<p>With that said, I&#39;m not dogmatic about the tools I use. I have no problem picking up new technologies if they help get the job done.</p>
<p>I&#39;m very motivated by creative software, and I&#39;ve just released the alpha version of a browser-based music workstation <a href="https://softelixir.app">here</a>. Check out a demo video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK4cvYAqNCU">here</a> for a quick introduction.</p>
<p>My experience as a remote contractor means I&#39;m used to working independently towards deadlines. I&#39;ve also worked with Scrum and Agile methodology. When I join a new team, I&#39;m quick to start adding value to the codebase.</p>
<p>I&#39;m originally from England, but I&#39;ve been fully resident in Sweden for over three years.</p>
<h2>Tools</h2>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<h3>Soft Elixir</h3>
<p>My current project is <a href="https://softelixir.app">Soft Elixir</a>, a sample-based music workstation that lives in the browser.</p>
<p><img src="./images/soft-elixir.png" alt="Soft Elixir"></p>
<p>Currently in alpha, everything is built by me.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to create, save, and edit songs entirely within the browser</li>
<li>Six tracks of audio and waveform visualisations</li>
<li>Deep editing functionality - see the <a href="https://softelixir.app/control-list.html">full control list</a> for details</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://softelixir.app/userguide">userguide</a> for a full rundown and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK4cvYAqNCU">here</a> for a demo video.</p>
<h3>Omställningsfonden</h3>
<p><img src="./images/omstallningsfonden.png" alt="omställningsfonden"></p>
<p><a href="https://minasidor.omstallningsfonden.se/logga-in">minasidor.omstallningsfonden.se</a></p>
<p>As one of two developers contracting for Omställningsfonden, I worked on a secure web app used by several thousand people each month.</p>
<p>Development on this project was very rapid. Each week, developers met with product owners to discuss business requirements to be implemented the following week.</p>
<p>Because of the short development cycle, we put a lot of effort into keeping the codebase lean and refactorable.</p>
<p>Some of the features we implemented were:</p>
<ul>
<li>BankID integration</li>
<li>CSS design systems</li>
<li>Interactive online forms</li>
</ul>
<h3>Loumee</h3>
<p><img src="./images/loumee.png" alt="Loumee"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.loumee.co/">loumee.co</a></p>
<p>The Loumee application delivers online games to users through a secure web app.</p>
<p>My main task with Loumee was to transform the codebase from an minimum viable product to a scalable and future-proof application.</p>
<p>One of the biggest changes I made was implementing a custom content management system. The result of this change was a much more agile process: non-technical users could now add content without the need to involve developers.</p>
<p>Some of the other features I implemented were:</p>
<ul>
<li>User data aggregation using <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/">Chart.js</a></li>
<li>Amazon S3 cloud storage</li>
<li>A customisable game system</li>
</ul>
<h3>Intelligenz</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.intelligenz.global/">intelligenz.global</a></p>
<p>When I joined Intelligenz, the software was a decade old and only available for Windows. For three years, I worked with a team of developers to migrate all existing functionality to a web app using ASP.NET.</p>
<p>Because of the project&#39;s scale, we focussed on splitting functionality into modules that could be built independently. We then developed a suite of APIs that managed communication between systems.</p>
<p>Some of the features I worked on were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Online payment processing</li>
<li>Authentication and authorization</li>
<li>Database integration</li>
</ul>
