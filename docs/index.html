        <h1>Patrick McGreal</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Hi, I&#39;m Patrick. I&#39;m a senior full-stack developer with seven years of experience.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve worked with the Microsoft .NET platform, as well as modern JavaScript frameworks like Vue and React. I&#39;ve also built custom frontend solutions using Web Components. I have a lot of experience building interactive web apps using both the Canvas API and the Web Audio API.</p>
<p>I&#39;m very motivated by creative applications, and I&#39;m currently working on building a browser-based digital audio workstation.</p>
<p>As a remote contractor, I&#39;m very used to managing my own time and working towards deadlines. I&#39;ve also worked with remote teams using Scrum and Agile methodology. When I join a new team, I&#39;m quick to start adding value to the codebase.</p>
<p>I&#39;m originally from England, but I live and work in Sweden.</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<h3>Soft Elixir</h3>
<p><a href="https://patrick-mcgreal-dev.github.io/soft-elixir-log/">Soft Elixir dev log</a></p>
<p>Soft Elixir is a digital audio workstation that lives in the browser.</p>
<p>Using the Web Audio API, Soft Elixir lets you create music by scheduling audio events with custom synthesizer functions.</p>
<p>This has been my biggest project so far, as it involves so many different technical domains: </p>
<ul>
<li>The Web Audio API for scheduling and generating sound</li>
<li>The canvas API for producing a fast and responsive user interface</li>
<li>Web workers for keeping audio and visuals synchronised</li>
<li>Web components for producing reusable HTML elements without the overhead of a JavaScript framework</li>
</ul>
<h3>Omställningsfonden</h3>
<p><a href="https://minasidor.omstallningsfonden.se/logga-in">minasidor.omstallningsfonden.se</a></p>
<p>As one of two developers contracting for Omställningsfonden, I built a secure web app used by several thousand people each month.</p>
<p>Development on this project was very rapid. Each week, developers would meet with product owners to discuss business requirements to be implemented the following week.</p>
<p>Because of the short development cycle, we put a lot of effort into keeping the codebase lean and refactorable.</p>
<p>Some of the features we implemented were:</p>
<ul>
<li>BankID integration</li>
<li>CSS design systems</li>
<li>Interactive online forms</li>
</ul>
<h3>Loumee</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.loumee.co/">loumee.co</a></p>
<p>The Loumee application delivers online games to users through a secure web app.</p>
<p>My main task with Loumee was to transform the codebase from an MVP solution to a scalable application that would survive the long term.</p>
<p>One of the biggest changes I made was to implement a content management system to allow non-technical users to add content to the app. The result of this change was a much more agile methodology: administrators could now add to the library of games without the need to involve developers.</p>
<p>Some of the other features I implemented were:</p>
<ul>
<li>User data aggregation using <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/">Chart.js</a></li>
<li>Amazon S3 cloud storage</li>
<li>A customisable game system</li>
</ul>
<h3>Intelligenz</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.intelligenz.global/">intelligenz.global</a></p>
<p>When I joined Intelligenz, the software was a decade old and only available for Windows. For three years, I worked with a team of developers to migrate all existing functionality to a web app using ASP.NET.</p>
<p>Because of the project&#39;s scale, we focussed on splitting functionality into modules that could be built independently. We then developed a suite of APIs that could be used to communicate between systems.</p>
<p>A lot of my time was also spent on ensuring that existing users of the desktop application would feel comfortable transitioning to the online version.</p>
<p>Some of the features I worked on were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Online payment processing</li>
<li>Authentication and authorization</li>
<li>Database integration</li>
</ul>
