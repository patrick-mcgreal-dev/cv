# Patrick McGreal - CV Build Tool

This is the tool I created to generate my online CV, [which can be found here](https://patrick-mcgreal-dev.github.io/cv/).

The CV is a simple static webpage, generated from the EJS, SASS, and markdown files found in [the src folder](https://github.com/patrick-mcgreal-dev/cv/tree/master/src).

My own [simple-ssg](https://github.com/patrick-mcgreal-dev/simple-ssg) module does most of the heavy lifting, and saves the processed files into [the docs folder](https://github.com/patrick-mcgreal-dev/cv/tree/master/docs).

GitHub pages automcatically picks up and serves up any files in this folder.
