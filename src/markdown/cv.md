# Patrick McGreal

## Summary

Hi, I'm Patrick. I'm a senior full-stack developer with almost a decade of experience.

I've worked with the Microsoft .NET platform, as well as modern JavaScript frameworks like Vue and React. I've also built custom frontend solutions using Web Components. I have a lot of experience building interactive web apps using both the Canvas API and the Web Audio API.

I'm very motivated by creative applications, and I'm currently working on a browser-based music workstation which you can find [here](https://softelixir.app). Check out a demo video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK4cvYAqNCU) for a quicker introduction.

As a remote contractor, I'm very used to managing my own time and working towards deadlines. I've also worked with remote teams using Scrum and Agile methodology. When I join a new team, I'm quick to start adding value to the codebase.

I'm originally from England, but I live and work in Sweden.

## Projects

### Soft Elixir

My current project is Soft Elixir, a sample-based music workstation that lives in the browser.

Currently in alpha, everything built by me.

Features:

- The ability to create, save, and edit songs entirely within the browser
- Six tracks of audio and waveform visualisations
- Deep editing possibilities - [see the full control list for details](https://softelixir.app/control-list.html)

[Check out the userguide](https://softelixir.app/userguide) for full details.

### Omställningsfonden

[minasidor.omstallningsfonden.se](https://minasidor.omstallningsfonden.se/logga-in)

As one of two developers contracting for Omställningsfonden, I built a secure web app used by several thousand people each month.

Development on this project was very rapid. Each week, developers would meet with product owners to discuss business requirements to be implemented the following week.

Because of the short development cycle, we put a lot of effort into keeping the codebase lean and refactorable.

Some of the features we implemented were:

- BankID integration
- CSS design systems
- Interactive online forms

### Loumee

[loumee.co](https://www.loumee.co/)

The Loumee application delivers online games to users through a secure web app.

My main task with Loumee was to transform the codebase from an MVP solution to a scalable application that would survive the long term.

One of the biggest changes I made was to implement a content management system to allow non-technical users to add content to the app. The result of this change was a much more agile methodology: administrators could now add to the library of games without the need to involve developers.

Some of the other features I implemented were:

- User data aggregation using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)
- Amazon S3 cloud storage
- A customisable game system

### Intelligenz

[intelligenz.global](https://www.intelligenz.global/)

When I joined Intelligenz, the software was a decade old and only available for Windows. For three years, I worked with a team of developers to migrate all existing functionality to a web app using ASP.NET.

Because of the project's scale, we focussed on splitting functionality into modules that could be built independently. We then developed a suite of APIs that could be used to communicate between systems.

A lot of my time was also spent on ensuring that existing users of the desktop application would feel comfortable transitioning to the online version.

Some of the features I worked on were:

- Online payment processing
- Authentication and authorization
- Database integration
