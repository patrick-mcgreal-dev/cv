# Patrick McGreal

## Summary

Hi, I'm Patrick. I'm a full-stack developer with almost a decade of experience.

Right now I work mainly with JavaScript frameworks like React and Vue in the frontend, and Node in the backend. I've also spent several years in the .NET world, and when it comes to databases I feel very comfortable with any flavour of SQL.

I'm not dogmatic about the tools I use, and I have no problem picking up new technologies if they help get the job done.

My experience as a remote contractor means I'm used to working independently towards deadlines. I've also worked with Scrum and Agile methodology. When I join a new team, I'm quick to start adding value to the codebase.

I'm originally from England, but I've been fully resident in Sweden for four years.

## For Qulinda...

Hi Qulinda,

Since reading the book "Losing Eden" (highly recommended), I've been looking for a project that combines my love of nature with my love of technology. Your startup feels like the perfect fit for me.

I'm deeply passionate about the natural world, and now that I have a daughter I'm determined to work towards its preservation. Working in a small team like yours would be a dream for me - I thrive when I'm able to make creative decisions about how to grow a product.

I'm especially interested in your wildlife monitoring projects. I would be so happy to sit in the forest with a laptop and field-test a prototype!

Let's speak soon - I'm really keen to hear more about your tech-stack and your plans for the future.

Mvh,
Patrick

Upsales is a browser-based sales and CRM system.

My work has covered the following:

- Building new features
- Replacing old Angular code with new React components
- Mentoring junior developers and documenting the codebase

### Soft Elixir
#### Apr 2023—present

[Soft Elixir](https://softelixir.app) is a sample-based music workstation that lives in the browser.

Currently in alpha, everything is built by me.

Features:

- The ability to create, save, and edit songs entirely within the browser
- Six tracks of audio and waveform visualisations
- Deep editing functionality - see the [full control list](https://softelixir.app/control-list.html) for details

Check out the [userguide](https://softelixir.app/userguide) for a full rundown and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK4cvYAqNCU) for a demo video.

### Omställningsfonden
#### Jan 2023—Mar 2023

[minasidor.omstallningsfonden.se](https://minasidor.omstallningsfonden.se/logga-in)

As one of two developers contracting for Omställningsfonden, I worked on a secure web app used by several thousand people each month.

Development on this project was very rapid. Each week, developers met with product owners to discuss business requirements to be implemented the following week.

Because of the short development cycle, we put a lot of effort into keeping the codebase lean and refactorable.

Some of the features we implemented were:

- BankID integration
- CSS design systems
- Interactive online forms

### Loumee
#### Jul 2021—Dec 2022

[loumee.co](https://www.loumee.co/)

The Loumee application delivers online games to users through a secure web app.

My main task with Loumee was to transform the codebase from an minimum viable product to a scalable and future-proof application.

One of the biggest changes I made was implementing a custom content management system. The result of this change was a much more agile process: non-technical users could now add content without the need to involve developers.

Some of the other features I implemented were:

- User data aggregation using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)
- Amazon S3 cloud storage
- A customisable game system

### Intelligenz
#### Jan 2015—Jan 2021

[intelligenz.global](https://www.intelligenz.global/)

When I joined Intelligenz, the software was a decade old and only available for Windows. For three years, I worked with a team of developers to migrate all existing functionality to a web app using ASP.NET.

Because of the project's scale, we focussed on splitting functionality into modules that could be built independently. We then developed a suite of APIs that managed communication between systems.

Some of the features I worked on were:

- Online payment processing
- Authentication and authorization
- Database integration
