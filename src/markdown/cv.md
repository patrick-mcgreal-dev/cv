# Patrick McGreal

## About me

Hi, I'm Patrick. I've been working as a full stack developer for over six years. I'm originally from the UK, but I live and work in Sweden.

I build public-facing web apps, and internal software for businesses.

There's lots of code [on my GitHub account](https://github.com/patrick-mcgreal-dev). Maybe you want to check out [the tool I use to generate this CV](https://github.com/patrick-mcgreal-dev/cv).

## Some projects I've worked on

### NanoDocs

NanoDocs is a tool I built for generating documentation. It's available as a [package via npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nanodocs).

It takes files written in Markdown format, and combines them into a single-page app that can be downloaded and browsed offline.

I continue to add new features, so check out the [documentation](https://patrick-mcgreal-dev.github.io/nanodocs-docs/) for more details.
